Pretty much all of the bad queries we had were because of performance issues and some focused on poor results (this was opinionated)
What we did to fix most of these issues were:
- We made it so if a query contained common words (words that had over 15k docs indexed for it) we just remove it from the query UNLESS the common words made up over 75% of the query
- In the beginning we had tf-idf scoring, but some queries like "master of software engineering", gave us results that we didn't particularly like, so we switched over to pure cosine similarty scoring
- We also created an index for the index, increasing the speed of accessing term data by a ton
- We began to store a lot of the data that we needed in the postings of our index file like tf score and document length because during querying, we can retrieve this information really fast instead of calculating it while querying
- We created a length mapping text file as well in order to quickly get the length of postings for a given term for cosine simiarity calulations
- Some words since no documents were found, it would end up crashing our program, but we added a fix in which if no result was found, we wouldn't enter the cosine similarity part and just output nothing, which saves us both speed and hassle
- With some terms, we would get less than 10 results, which would end up breaking our program as well, but we made it so if theres less than 10 results, we just output the whole list ranked in order
- Some queries we used produced a lot of missing content pages, but I believe that this one is out of our control
- For empty queries, it used to create a lot of division by 0 errors within our program, but we fixed it by checking if the query_input had something in it or not
