Things to still do:
-----------------------------------
INDEX PORTION:
    - clean up merge functino in index by making functions to break it down
    - remember to remove previous indexes after merging
    - somehow not completing sorting the term values in index (need to fix)
    - make decision to use nltk tokenzier or our own tokenizer
    - break down indexer into more functions (maybe?)

QUERY PORTION:
    - Only boolean search implemented right now, need ranked search
    - implement positions
    - implement tfid ranking

BOTH:
    - need to add tons of comments on all files for explanation
    - need to update README.md to make an in depth tutorial on how to use
